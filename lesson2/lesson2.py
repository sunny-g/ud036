''' lesson 2 - building a movie website
build a site that hosts movie trailers and their info

steps:
    1. we need:
        title
        synopsis
        release date
        ratings
    this means we need a template for this data,
        ex: avatar.show_info(), toyStory.show_trailer()
    but we dont want to use separate modules/files for each movie
